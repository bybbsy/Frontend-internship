#### :rocket: Basics -> The app with plain js (work with core js, classes and other plain js stuff).
#### :rocket: Vue -> Vue 2 app with router.
#### :rocket: Vuex-app -> Vue application made with VueJS 3, Vuex and Router.

Vuex-app has two branches: **main and ts-vue**. In both branches vuex was used for state management.

I do know that it's not suppused to use vuex store for nav menu, modal state management. But in this project I use vuex for such purposes in order to achieve more experience with vuex.
